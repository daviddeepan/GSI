# GSI (GoStackInit) 🚀

GSI (GoStackInit) is a simple CLI tool to quickly bootstrap Go API projects with your preferred stack.  
Think of it like `npm init` but for Go backends.

It guides you through interactive prompts to choose:

- API framework (Fiber, Gorilla Mux, etc.)
- Database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite)
- ORM (GORM, SQLC, Bun, or none)
- Project name

and then generates a ready-to-run project structure for you.
